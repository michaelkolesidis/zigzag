# ðŸ”’ ZigZag Security Policy

**ZigZag** is a small personal project, and while I do my best to ensure it's safe and secure, I cannot take responsibility for any security issues or vulnerabilities that may occur. This includes â€” but is not limited to â€” issues arising from third-party libraries, deployment platforms (such as Vercel or Netlify), or user interactions with the game.

Users should take reasonable precautions when using the game. If you notice any security-related issues, your feedback is appreciated.

## ðŸ“¢ Reporting a Vulnerability  

If you discover a potential vulnerability, please get in touch by:  

- Opening an issue on the project repository, or  
- Sending an email to [michael.kolesidis@gmail.com](mailto:michael.kolesidis@gmail.com)

If the issue relates to a third-party tool or framework, please also consider reporting it to the maintainers of that project.
