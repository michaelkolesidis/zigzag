## üß© Core Gameplay Mechanics

| **Feature**                      | **Description**                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **One-Tap Control**              | Tap the screen (or click) to change the ball‚Äôs direction by 90¬∞. No other inputs are used. |
| **Zigzag Path**                  | The path is made of square tiles in alternating zigzag directions.                         |
| **Endless Generation**           | The path is procedurally generated and continues indefinitely.                             |
| **Falling Off**                  | The ball falls off the edge if you mistime a turn ‚Äî this ends the game.                    |
| **Camera Follow**                | The camera smoothly follows the ball from a top-down, slightly angled view.                |
| **Score System**                 | Earn 1 point for each tile successfully crossed.                                           |
| **Gem Collection**               | Gems appear on random tiles; collecting them adds 1 point to your score.                   |
| **+1 Floating Text**             | A ‚Äú+1‚Äù text briefly appears and fades out at the gem‚Äôs position when collected.            |
| **Speed Scaling**                | The ball‚Äôs speed gradually increases, raising difficulty as you progress.                  |
| **High Score**                   | The game saves and displays your best score.                                               |
| **Minimal UI**                   | Clean interface showing score, best score, and audio toggle.                               |
| **No Pause**                     | Once gameplay starts, it cannot be paused.                                                 |
| **Optional Sound**               | Subtle sound effects for turning, collecting gems, and UI interactions.                    |
| **No Tutorials**                 | The game starts instantly with no instructions ‚Äî easy to learn by playing.                 |
| **Playable on Mobile & Desktop** | Optimized for both touchscreens and mouse clicks ‚Äî works on all devices.                   |
