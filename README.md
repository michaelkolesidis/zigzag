## üéÆ Overview

ZigZag is a minimalist, abstract endless runner where the player controls a black ball ‚ö´ rolling along a narrow, zigzagging ‚ÜñÔ∏è‚ÜóÔ∏è path suspended in midair. With each tap, the ball changes direction by 90¬∞, and the goal is to stay on the path for as long as possible. The challenge lies in tapping the screen at the right moment to prevent the ball from falling off the edges. This simple, one-touch mechanic creates a high-stakes test of timing and precision, as a single misstep sends the ball tumbling off the path, ending the run.

The path is endlessly and procedurally generated, forming a jagged zigzag route that demands increasing focus and reflexes as the speed subtly ramps up. Along the way, players can collect purple gems that spawn randomly on tiles, adding an optional layer of reward.

Visually, the game is stripped to its core elements: clean geometric shapes, soft pastel hues, and no clutter ‚Äî just motion and form. The world feels abstract and ambient, keeping full focus on the gameplay. There are no tutorials, no pause, and no distractions ‚Äî just the ball, the path, and your reactions.
